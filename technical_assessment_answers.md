# Tikos Research Engineering Technical Assessment

This document provides comprehensive answers to the technical assessment scenarios. The implementation code for these solutions is available in the project structure, with some components implemented as proof-of-concept.

## Question 1: Scalable Data Processing & API Integration

### Data Ingestion, Transformation, and Storage

Our solution uses a scalable architecture with FastAPI, Celery, and PostgreSQL to handle large amounts of data from various external APIs. The implementation includes:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: 
   - Supports both RESTful and GraphQL API sources
   - Implements asynchronous processing to prevent blocking
   - Uses Celery for distributed task processing

2. **Transformation Pipeline**:
   - Basic framework for a configurable transformation system
   - Placeholder functions for operations like field renaming and filtering
   - Extensible design for adding more complex transformations

3. **Storage Layer**:
   - Uses PostgreSQL for structured data storage
   - JSON column type for flexible data storage
   - Simple indexing on key fields

```python
# Key data ingestion component
def start_ingestion_job(sources, transformation_rules=None):
    """Start a new data ingestion job and return the job ID."""
    job_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    # Store the job request in the database
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        request = DataRequest(id=job_id, status="pending")
        db.add(request)
        db.commit()
    finally:
        db.close()
    
    # Start the Celery task asynchronously
    process_data.delay(job_id, sources, transformation_rules)
    
    return job_id
```

### API Architecture Design

The RESTful API is designed with the following considerations:

1. **Performance**:
   - Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
   - Database connection pooling via SQLAlchemy
   - Response pagination and filtering to limit data transfer

2. **Reliability**:
   - Task retries with exponential backoff for transient failures
   - Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
   - Database transactions to maintain data consistency

3. **Security**:
   - Input validation using Pydantic models
   - CORS configuration for controlling API access

### Parallel Processing Implementation

Our solution employs several parallel processing strategies:

1. **Task-based Parallelism**:
   - Celery workers process multiple ingestion jobs concurrently
   - Task retries for handling transient failures

2. **Data Parallelism**:
   - Each data source is processed independently
   - Error handling at the source level

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Redis as the broker and backend for Celery tasks
   - Separation of API and worker processes in Docker containers

### Error Handling and Logging

The system implements a comprehensive approach to error handling and logging:

1. **Structured Logging**:
   - Consistent log format with contextual information
   - Log levels for filtering (INFO, ERROR)
   - Both file and console logging outputs

2. **Error Categories**:
   - Source errors (API unavailable)
   - Processing errors (transformation failures)
   - Database errors (transaction issues)

3. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Automatic retries for failed tasks
   - Error state persistence in the database
   - Detailed error messages for debugging

## Question 2: Machine Learning Model Integration & Deployment

### PyTorch Model Deployment as RESTful API

Our deployment approach follows these steps:

1. **Model Preparation**:
   - Convert model to TorchScript for production optimization
   - Define input/output schemas and validation rules
   - Package model artifacts with configuration metadata

2. **API Development**:
   - FastAPI endpoints for prediction and model management
   - Asynchronous request handling for scalability
   - Input validation with Pydantic models

3. **Containerization**:
   - Docker image with optimized dependencies
   - Environment configuration via volumes
   - Resource limit specifications

4. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Docker Compose for local development/testing
   - CI/CD pipeline definition with GitHub Actions

### Model Versioning, Updates, and Monitoring

Our solution implements a comprehensive model management approach:

1. **Versioning Strategy**:
   - Immutable model artifacts with version identifiers
   - Version-specific model loading and inference
   - Default model selection mechanism

2. **Update Process**:
   - API endpoints for uploading new model versions
   - Model activation/deactivation capabilities
   - Version-specific metrics and monitoring

3. **Model Registry**:
   - File-based storage of model versions
   - Model discovery and metadata access
   - Version management through the API

### Performance Optimization for Real-time Inference

To ensure low-latency predictions, we've implemented:

1. **Model Optimization Techniques**:
   - TorchScript for optimized inference
   - No-grad evaluation mode for predictions
   - Batch inference support

2. **API Optimizations**:
   - Background tasks for non-critical operations
   - Inference time tracking and reporting
   - Error handling for prediction failures

### Model Performance and Data Drift Monitoring

Our monitoring system includes:

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Inference time tracking (min, max, average)
   - Request count tracking
   - Performance degradation detection

2. **Data Drift Detection**:
   - Statistical distribution comparison capabilities
   - Feature-level drift detection
   - Significance testing for drift metrics

3. **Metrics Storage**:
   - File-based metrics storage
   - JSON-based metrics aggregation
   - Time-series performance analysis

### CI/CD Pipeline for Machine Learning Models

Our CI/CD pipeline is designed specifically for ML workflows:

1. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Automated testing setup
   - Code coverage reporting
   - Dependency installation

2. **Continuous Delivery**:
   - Docker image building and publishing
   - Version tagging for deployments

3. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - Production deployment through SSH
   - Containerized deployment strategy
   - Secret management for credentials

## Question 3: Database Design & Query Optimization

### Database Schema Design and Justification

For the complex relationship-based dataset, we've designed a hybrid approach using both SQL and graph databases:

1. **Primary Storage: PostgreSQL (SQL Database)**
   - **Justification**: SQL databases excel at structured data with well-defined relationships, ACID compliance, and complex reporting needs. PostgreSQL specifically offers excellent query performance, JSON support for semi-structured data, and mature tooling.
   
   - **Key Tables**:
     - DataRequest (tracking ingestion jobs)
     - ProcessedData (storing transformed data)
     - Additional tables would be added for a full implementation

2. **Supplementary Storage: Graph Database**
   - **Justification**: For complex relationship analysis, recommendation engines, and traversal-heavy queries, graph databases offer significant performance advantages.
   
   - This component is described conceptually but not implemented in the current codebase.

### Sample SQL Queries and Optimization

1. **Find processed data by category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM processed_data
WHERE category = 'specific_category'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Optimization techniques**:
- Index on the category column
- Limit results to control data volume
- Order by timestamp for most recent data

### Query Optimization for Large Datasets

1. **Indexing Strategies**:
   - B-tree indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Index on category field for filtering

2. **Connection Pooling**:
   - SQLAlchemy session management
   - Proper session cleanup in request handlers

3. **Query Optimization**:
   - Filtering before pagination
   - Limiting result sets
   - Using appropriate indexes

### SQL vs. NoSQL Comparison

**SQL Databases**:
- **Strengths**: 
  - Strong consistency and ACID transactions
  - Rich query language with joins and aggregations
  - Well-defined schema enforcing data integrity
  - Mature ecosystem with robust tooling
  - Excellent for complex reporting and analytics

- **Limitations**:
  - Schema rigidity makes changes difficult
  - Horizontal scaling challenges (though improving)
  - Join performance degrades with very large datasets
  - Not ideal for semi-structured or frequently changing data

**NoSQL Databases**:
- **Strengths**:
  - Schema flexibility for evolving data models
  - Horizontal scalability for massive datasets
  - High throughput for specific access patterns
  - Specialized structures for different data types (document, key-value, column, graph)
  - Better performance for certain query patterns

- **Limitations**:
  - Limited transaction support (though improving)
  - Weaker consistency models (eventual vs. strong)
  - Less standardized query languages
  - Often requires denormalization increasing data duplication
  - Less mature tooling for certain operations

**When to Choose Each**:

Choose SQL when:
- Data has a clear relational structure
- Transactions and data integrity are critical
- Complex queries involving multiple entities are common
- Schema is well-defined and relatively stable
- Comprehensive reporting is required

Choose NoSQL when:
- Schema flexibility and evolution is important
- Extremely high write throughput is needed
- Data is naturally hierarchical or graph-structured
- Massive horizontal scaling is required
- The application needs specialized data models (documents, time-series, graph)

In practice, many modern systems adopt a polyglot persistence approach, using different database types for different aspects of the system based on their specific strengths and requirements.
